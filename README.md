## Features

### Navigation around the site

The website consists of five different web parts: Home , contact us, services, about and training.

The navigation bar changes into a toggler when viewed on a smaller sized screen such as mobile phone. When the screen size is shrinks, the “Menu” button appears which then can be clickable to display a dropdown menu that enables the navigation through the app.

Home Page:

This home page is quite a basic intro page for the user when they land on the web app. On here you find calling image of beatful and healthy dog.

This is quite a summary to quickly cover what the web app is about.

I have implemented 6 button link d-walk, s-sit, d-boad, d-vet, d-shop, d-groom . These links will take the user to the services provided by google map place.

In terms of responsiveness, The buttons will be centered on mobile, the button will shrink to fit the width af all devices.

## Contact Page

The contact section consists of a form which can be used for the user to get in touch with me directly. or to ask for general question or tips.

To do this section, I have also implemented a google maps API which shows our office location.

These features are all responsive within the web app and can enlarge/shrink in a suitable matter to meet the right user experience needs depending on the size of the screen.

JAVASCRIPT Test: ![Alt](assets/images/javascript.png "test")

- I tested the application across multiple desktop browsers including Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari and all is well with these browsers.

Test: ![Alt](assets/images/console.png "test")

- Navigation links: Each navigation link has been tested to ensure that it is linked to the correct section. The navigation link has also been tested when viewed on a smaller screen sizes to ensure the functionality is consistent making sure the toggler is activated correctly.

- Contact links: I have tested these links to makesure that they redirect correctly to the contact form for the user to get in touch.
- Google maps API (Allowing location): I have tested this on my end to make sure that when location is enabled, the map shows the exact correct location of my area and displays all nearby dog services.

Google maps API (clicking on the marker): I have tested all the markers to make sure that each place dispalys the full name and the rating.

- Contact form: Each field was tested thoroughly to make sure that the mandatory functionality worked. I have tested the following fields: Full name, email address, subject, message. The form has failed to submit if any of the fields was left blank. I have also tested that the modal window pops up confirming that the form has been submitted when processed successfully. The email address field has also been tested when trying to insert an invalid email address. The form fails to submit as the email address is not written in the correct format.
- Social media icons: The social media icons in the footer section have all been tested to make sure they are linked correctly and work fine. The “blank” attribute have also been tested on all of them to make sure that when they are clicked, a new window is open rather than navigating away from the web app.
- Button hover: The button with the hover effect have been tested across the web app. The functionality was working correctly and it changes colour when hovered over.

All images have been tested to make sure they change size when resizing the screen. Background images were tested to make sure that they are covering each section no matter what the screen size is.

The web app content was checked and tested to make sure that there was no error.

## Cross browser/device testing

### iPad

Safari: The web app has been tested to make sure all sections are appearing correctly on iPad making sure the media queries are working as expected. This has been tested as landscape as well as portrait.

Chrome: The web app has also been tested on the chrome browser making sure it is displayed consistently a long with Safari on the iPad device.

iPad: ![iPad](assets/images/ipad.png "ipad")

Desktop:

Chrome: Testing was done to make sure all images/content was displayed clearly on the large desktop screen.

Firefox: Testing was also carried on Firefox to make sure everything is consistent with chrome.

Android phone:

Android internet: Tested mainly to make sure the web app is responsive correctly on small screen sizes. This was tested through landscape and portrait orientation.

Chrome: The web app was also tested on chrome mainly for orientation purposes.

## Issues found and resolved

The google maps on the services page was not displaying correctly in size and not stretching across the container. This was due to certain bootstrap classes which prevented it from showing in width of 100%. The classes have been removed and the map is displayed correctly.
